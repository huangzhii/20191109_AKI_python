sensitivity: the percentage of AKI people who are correctly identified as having the condition,,,,,,,,,,,,
specificity: the percentage of healthy people who are correctly identified as not having the condition,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With more series, sensitivity grows down, specificity grows up",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Comparing to all feature, the feature without in-output gives us lower sensitivity but higher specificity",,,,,,,,,,,,
